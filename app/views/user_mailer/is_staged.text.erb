Dear <%= @name %>,

<%= ORGANIZATION_NAME %> is happy to report that your RDF has been processed without errors. Your project is now available for testing in our staging environment: http://staging.nines.org/collex (username: sandbox / password: testing). Please explore your material as it appears in Collex to ensure there are no errors or broken links.

When you are satisfied with your content in Staging, please contact the <%= raw @main_editor %>, or simply reply to this message. Please do so as soon as possible, however, as the peer review process cannot begin without your approval.
